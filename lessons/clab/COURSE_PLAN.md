## Next Steps

1. [ ] Review and approve this course plan
2. [ ] Create repository folder structure
3. [ ] Create Lesson 1 topology files
4. [ ] Write Lesson 1 exercises and solutions
5. [ ] Create automated tests for Lesson 1
6. [ ] Record Lesson 1 video
7. [ ] Write transcript
8. [ ] Iterate for remaining lessons

## Questions for Review

1. Does the 8-lesson structure feel right, or should we consolidate to 6?
2. Should Lesson 4 (Data Center) come before or after Lesson 5 (Cloud Patterns)?
3. Are there specific network concepts critical for your curriculum that we should ensure are covered?
4. Should we include a "Lesson 0" that covers Docker networking basics as a bridge from the K8s course?
